Resnet training:
    Due: 25/07
    Description: Run training including implementation of debug utilities (loss and accuracy curves).

Resnet errors mapping:
    Due: 28/07
    Description: Manually explore images on which the resnet architecture fails.

RNN module:

Compare Resnet to RNN on fixed-size inputs:
    Due: 02/08
    Description: Compare Resnet to RNN on fixed-size inputs (accuracy and loss on validation sets, convergence time).

Noise pixels:
    Due: 05/08
    Description: Add random noise pixels to the input, re-train and check the accuracy on the validation set.

RNN tuning:
    Due: 10/08
    Description: Tune the RNN network to improve noise-handling. Compare to regular RNN.
